            <b>I can’t see.</b>                                                                                                               <br> 

            I slowly close my eyes. My body shakes slightly as I feel parts of my skin press against the bed and the sheets… but… it wasn’t that bad. Hiding under the blankets made so the darkness almost felt… normal.
            - “It’s dark...” The voice said
            - But it’s like it should be… I replied
                My eyes finally closed, the heat of my body slowly starting to overcome the sheer cold from the bed and sheets. My mind started to drift off into nothing as the feeling of my tiredness finally struck me. 
            It wasn’t dark anymore. But it was neither bright. I could see, but I wasn’t seeing anything. it was just… blank. 
                I look around. There’s nothing to see. Nothing under me, nothing above and nothing to the sides. My eyes runned from side to side, trying to figure out where I was. There’s a small shade of grey everywhere I looked, but it was so far away. Is there even anything here?
            It felt like I was floating in space. I couldn’t move, just spin around and hope that I could find something. as I was looking from size to side, I felt something hit my back. I shiver. My eyes grew wide as a gust of hot wind suddenly hitted me. 
            - “What… is that...” The voice said. But it wasn’t coming from me anymore. As I look to my side I see a man, with long, black hair and a slightly dark skin. He was wearing a completely white suit, and was floating like I was. His hair was flying back, like there was some kind of wind blowing against it. But the actual thing that brought my attention was his expression. He was looking at something, and his face was in absolute terror. He looked like he was trying to walk away, but he was stuck in place. 
            - Who... are you?
            He seemed to finally notice that I was there, the moment he looked at me, his eyes went wide, wider than they already were. One of his hands slowly moved up, his index finger pointing at something right behind me.
                As I turned around, I could see something dark. A giant, black figure was standing right behind me. The only thing possible to make out were big and bright eyes, with no pupils or iris. Just two white orbs, staring directly at me.
