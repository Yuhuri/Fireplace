            Everything is dark. Way too dark. I know something is wrong, but… what is it? And how do I fix it? “Why? Why can’t I see?” I ask myself… No answers. 
                I can feel the cold sheets under me as I keep hugging my legs. My eyes wide open but not a single bit of light coming in… 
            - It’s so dark… Am I asleep? 
            - “Wait no, I’m not.” 
            - But how would I even know if I am? 
            - “I’m just... not” 
            - But, I've been alone for so long… How am I still alive if this isn’t a dream? Where am I?
            - “...”
                The voice in my head stays quiet for a while. Where am I anyways? The walls are cold. The ground is cold, the bed is cold. I know every part of this place, even though I haven’t ever left these sheets. There’s no exit, it’s just an empty room.
            - “It’s so dark...”
            - I can’t see…
                This is unbearable. Is it day? Is it night? I don’t know. It's so lonely... So dark. All I can do is talk to myself. There’s no light. There’s no people. There’s no noise. There’s just... me.
            
                I can’t see. I know my eyes are open. I know I’m not blind. I know I should be able to see, but I‘m not. And why is it? Why can’t I see?
                As I move my hands up to my face, I touch my now-closed eyelids. I can feel my eyes inside of them, I know they’re still there. 
            - Are they damaged? 
            - “No, it would hurt if they were.”
            It was true. I couldn't feel any scars or damage to my eyes through the eyelids, and it just didn’t hurt to touch it. My eyes are fine, I’m not blind.
                I let out a sigh, slowly laying down on the bed and pulling the sheets up, covering my whole body with it and just feeling how cold everything was. What should I do now?
