            <b>I can’t see.</b>                                                                                                               <br> 

            I kept myself awake, there was no reason why to sleep as I would just end up waking up here again. So why not use this time to think?
            While laying down under the cold sheets I felt a bit more… comfortable. Like the darkness wasn’t part of me, just around me instead. Even the feeling of the cold bed and sheets weren’t that bad, as they were slowly starting to get warmer because of the natural heat from my body.
        -  “This… isn’t the worst...” Said the voice. It sounded strangely soothing
        - Can I see again?
        - “I don’t think so”
            This went on for a while. Even though I was pretty sleepy, I kept my eyes open. This feeling of freedom, that the darkness wasn’t the one in control anymore... It was great…
